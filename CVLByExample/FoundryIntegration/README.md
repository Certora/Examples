# Foundry Fuzz Testing Integration
The Certora Prover can integrate easily with the Foundry fuzz tests and formally verify the test cases using a very simple spec file and enabling `"foundry_tests_mode": true` in the conf file.
For more information go to [Certora's Documentation]()

This directory contains several examples of runs using Foundry integrations to demonstrate how to use it and how the Prover report looks like.

*NOTE: This feature is in early alpha stages.*
