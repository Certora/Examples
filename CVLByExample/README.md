These examples can serve as an introduction to CVL ( Certora Verification Language ).
It also contains examples that are based on real-life code and the spec that have caught critical bugs.

See https://docs.certora.com for a complete guide. 


To run the examples, use the provided configuration: 
```
cd ConstantProductPoolExample 
certoraRun ConstantProductPoolExample/certora/conf/run.conf 
```

This will result in a run with violations as seen [here](https://prover.certora.com/output/40726/b2c63e002e864e9d94b6ee03bf49cef0?anonymousKey=b8b428b78410796d656109f8f2b6436202e139f5).

For the fixed version, ConstantProductPoolFixed.sol run:
```certoraRun ConstantProductPoolExample/certora/conf/runFixed.conf```
