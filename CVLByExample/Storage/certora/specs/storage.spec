/**
  @title Storage Example
 
  This is an example specification for comparing storage (`lastStorage`) and `nativeBalances`.
  The spec demontstrates:
  1. Changes in storage in case of successful/unsuccessful transactions.
  2. Changes in `lastStorage` when changing data structures of the current contract.
  3. The relation between the balances of the sender and the receiver of a transaction.
  4. Changes in ghost storage.
