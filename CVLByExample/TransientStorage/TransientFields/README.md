# TransientStorage Example with transient field syntax

## Overview
This folder contains a smart contract named `TransientTest` that implements a simple lock via a transient boolean field. The spec file demonstrates how we can use the `Tstore` and `Tload` hooks to hook on accesses to such fields, and shows also that we can use direct storage access from CVL on such fields as well.
