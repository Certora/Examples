# Comparison of Mixed Integer Types

In this small example we show how one can simply compare between different types of integer values in CVL without any explicit conversion.
The example includes a small contract called `Ints` which has some simple integer values related functions and a spec file `MixedIntsComparison` which shows different rules that use ints comparisons.

You can run this example using:
```certoraRun MixedIntsComparison.conf```
