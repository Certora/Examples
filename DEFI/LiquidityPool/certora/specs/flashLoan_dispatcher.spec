/***
 * With the `DISPATCHER` summary, the Certora Prover will assume that the recipient
 * of the `executeOperation` method could be any contract in the scene that
 * implements `executeOperation`.  The outcome of verification therefore
 * depends on the set of contracts provided on the scene.
 *
 * You can verify this spec by running any of the following scripts:
 *
 *  - `certoraRun FlashLoanNoDispatchers.conf` will verify the spec
 *    with no valid dispatchers on the scene; this will treat the method as a
 *    `HAVOC_ALL` summary.
 *
 *  - `certoraRun FlashLoanTrivial.conf` will verify the spec with
 *    only a trivial `FlashLoanReceiver` implementation.
 *  
 *  - `certoraRun FlashLoanTransfer.conf` will verify the spec with a
 *    malicious reciever that transfers the money from the pool. 
 *
 *
 * See [the multi-contract section of the user guide][guide] for a complete
 * discussion of this example.
