# Simple Dapp Testing

This example is based on [a Cyfrin repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/fuzz-testing-on-foundry). It features a Solidity contract named `SimpleDapp`, which allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether (ETH). The contract functions as a basic ETH vault, enabling users to securely deposit funds and withdraw them later.

Additionally, there is a fuzz test contract named `SimpleDappTest`, designed to verify the functionality of the deposit and withdrawal methods. It ensures, in particular, that a user cannot withdraw more than their deposited amount.

To run this example, use:
```certoraRun SimpleDappTest.conf```
