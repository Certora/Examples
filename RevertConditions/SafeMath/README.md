# SafeMath Reverts
SafeMath is a Solidity library developed by OpenZeppelin that wraps over Solidity math operation to prevent undefined behaviors.
Instead, when such a state is reached (for example division by 0) the SafeMath will be responsible to revert the transaction.
From Solidity 8.0 onward, the checks SafeMath provides are implemented at the language level and SafeMath doesn't need to be imported to get them.

The simple contract and spec in this example demonstrate 3 different reverts on 3 undefined states that SafeMath catches.
`SafeMathReverts.sol` is a contract that has a uint256 value which can be manipulated in different ways, it can be increased, decreased and divided. The spec checks that no matter the amounts value is being manipulated with, the contract will always revert when reaching an undefined state.

The 3 undefined states are:
* Overflow - Value can be represented by a maximum of 256 bits of memory. An overflow is a state in which a value gets bigger than the maximum number that can be represented by 256 bits.
* Underflow - Value is an unsigned integer, that means it cannot be negative (cannot have a minus sign). An underflow is a state in which value becomes negative when it cannot.
* Division by zero - This is a very big math no no, division by zero is simply not defined!

Run this spec using:
```certoraRun SafeMathReverts.conf```
