/***
 This rule demonstrates how the source of amount transferred affects the balance of the current contract.
 This rule fails for `Auction.sol` because:
 1. The balance of `currentContract` is increased by `msg.value` at the entrance to `bid()`.
 2. the sender changes to `currentContract` in internal `bid()` and all his balance is transferred, so his balance does not increase.
 This rule passes for `AuctionFixed.sol` because only `currentBid` is transferred.

/***
 This rule demonstrates how the source of amount transferred affects the balance of the current contract.
 This rule passes vacuously for `Auction.sol` because of the `require e.msg.value > nativeBalances[currentContract]` in the spec
 and `require msg.value >= msg.value + nativeBalances[currentContract]` in the code where `nativeBalances[currentContract] > 0`.
 It passes non-vacuously for AuctionFixed.sol because the amount transferred is `currentBid` for which `msg.value >= currentBid`
 can hold.
