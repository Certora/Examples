This directory contains examples for [Function Summaries](https://github.com/Certora/Documentation/blob/master/docs/cvl/methods.md)
The interface `IntGetter` has the functions `get1()` and `get2()` that have no implementation. 
Function summaries are used instead of their arbitrary implementations. Since IntGetter is an interface and not a contract a 
wildcard entry is used.

## Always.spec
Here the function `g1` is summarized by `ALWAYS(7)` while `g2` is not summarized.
Therefore, the rule `checkNotSummarized` fails.

Run via ```certoraRun certora/conf/runAlways.conf```

## AlwaysVsConstant.spec

Here the function `g1` is summarized by `ALWAYS(7)` while `g2` is summarized by `CONSTANT`.
This means that all calls to `g2` always return the same result but it can be other than `7` which is what `g1` is summarized to.
Therefore, the rule checkAlwaysSummary passes, while the rule checkConstantSummary fails.

## ConstantVSNondet.spec

Here the function `g1` is summarized by `CONTANT` while `g2` is summarized by `NONDET`.
This means that all calls to `g1` always return the same result and therefore the rule `checkConstantSummary` passes.
Since `g2` is summarized with `NONDET` two calls to `getFromG2()` can have different results and therefore the
rule `checkNondetSummary` fails.

Run via ```certoraRun certora/conf/runConstantVsNondet.conf```
